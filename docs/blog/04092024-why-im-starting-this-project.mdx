# AI-IFY

## Few thoughts on where we've been

I've been at this hacking shit for quite a while by now.  I've had computers in my household my entire life,
but this means more than if I were to state it if I had been born after the 90's.  I vividly remember
using a program / machine called **VideoPainter** to create and design digital scenes, with a lot of
creativity for a program made for children.  I felt incredibly empowered.  In the age of AI, I feel like that's
something worth reminding people.  This was in 1990.  I was able to record my scenes using a blank VHS tape and 
capturing the screen over a prefixed amount of time.  
Watching the finished tape was like attending a kid's art show!
In 2000 or 2001, I taped over the VideoPainter VHS with my band's music.
We called ourselves Two Story Drop.
I still collaborate with the guitarist of that group.

## Where we are

Fast forward 34 years, to now, the year 2024.  Let's look at the current world we find ourselves living in.
It seems to me this is the time when companies are starting to **AI-ify** everything that can
exist under the sun.  If AI can _improve_ some experience (in some aspect), then it's worth the investment
of the deployment of billions of dollars.

## Where we're gonna be

If humans who consider themselves responsible people are not careful, __we are doomed to 
lose the battle to AI__.  Hard working folks will no longer have development opportunities
which lowers the likelihood of showcasing the web platform in meaninful and novel ways.
